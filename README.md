## Design Concept Completion

This week, I completed the design concept, which was presented by hand drawing.

## Modeling with Grasshopper and Rhino

I also completed modeling with Grasshopper and Rhino. Then, I used a laser cutter to cut out different panels on a large piece of acrylic board.

## Summary of the week

In the past one week (including an excited three-day weekend), I completed the 3D printing training online, and learned about Grasshopper tutorial by watching Youtube videos. This gave me a better understanding of Grasshopper, even though I still can't quite accept it as my main tool when designing. 

## Demonstration of the Ideal Phone Stand (My Rhino crashed when I tried to apply the grid texture onto its surface so I do not have a model yet)

Also this week, I sketched an ideal phone stand. I hope there is a phone stand that can support a foldable phone in two different folded states. I used Rhino to do some simple demonstrations.I'm a model enthusiast for warships, and I took inspiration from a photo-etched structure I recently assembled.

## Learning Challenges with Grasshopper

In the process of learning Grasshopper, I still have no way to fully understand the relationship between different batteries. At the current stage, Rhino and Fusion 360 are still my main tools for modeling.Maybe these tools are more useful for products without complex structures. However, I think what I learned in Grasshopper, such as the texture or grid of the surface of the object, will help me build more diverse products in the future.

# Report 1 - Week of 08/21/2023 #

## Learning State and Excitement about the Project

This week I gradually started to enter the state of learning. I was very excited when I heard that we can design a stand for a specific mobile phone, because I have a different mobile phone—Xiaomi Mix Fold 3.

### The Two States of Folding Phones

The folding screen mobile phone has two states, open and folded. I took measurements on my phone, which will help me in the later design. I predict that this mobile phone stand should be able to support two types of mobile phones at the same time.

### Market Trends

More and more folding screen mobile phones have appeared on the market. Perhaps this mobile phone stand will bring convenience to people.

## Laser Cutter Experience

At the same time, I also tried to use a laser cutter to cut the model of the mobile phone holder on the wooden board. It was not a perfect attempt, because the laser cutting machine did not completely cut the wood due to the adjustment of the parameters.

### Lessons Learned

So, I had to use a utility knife to remove and polish the wood, but I think it was a good lesson.
