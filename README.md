## Learning State and Excitement about the Project

This week I gradually started to enter the state of learning. I was very excited when I heard that we can design a stand for a specific mobile phone, because I have a different mobile phone—Xiaomi Mix Fold 3.

### The Two States of Folding Phones

The folding screen mobile phone has two states, open and folded. I took measurements on my phone, which will help me in the later design. I predict that this mobile phone stand should be able to support two types of mobile phones at the same time.

### Market Trends

More and more folding screen mobile phones have appeared on the market. Perhaps this mobile phone stand will bring convenience to people.

## Laser Cutter Experience

At the same time, I also tried to use a laser cutter to cut the model of the mobile phone holder on the wooden board. It was not a perfect attempt, because the laser cutting machine did not completely cut the wood due to the adjustment of the parameters.

### Lessons Learned

So, I had to use a utility knife to remove and polish the wood, but I think it was a good lesson.
